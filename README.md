goiardi-schema
==============

This is a [sqitch][] project for managing the [goairdi][] as they're developed. 
Using sqitch for managing the schemas for goiardi was inspired by seeing 
[chef-server-schema][], but while the goiardi schemas obviously have a lot in 
common with the official erchef schemas, they aren't the same.

At the moment the MySQL goiardi schema is under development. A Postgres schema 
is planned, but won't even be started until after the MySQL schema's done.

## Usage
